Graphite is a sophisticated desktop application that revolutionizes interaction with Large Language Models (LLMs). It transforms standard linear chat conversations into a dynamic, non-linear visual workspace. Built with Python and PySide6, Graphite leverages local LLMs via Ollama to provide a secure, private, and powerful tool for brainstorming, research, and complex problem-solving.

## Overview

Traditional chatbot interfaces confine conversations to a single, chronological timeline. This linear format stifles creativity and makes it difficult to revisit, branch, or organize complex lines of thought.

Graphite solves this by treating every conversation as an interactive mind-map on an infinite canvas. Each prompt and response becomes a distinct node, visually connected to form a branching graph of your entire dialogue. This unique approach allows you to trace the evolution of ideas, explore multiple paths from any point in the conversation, and build a rich, interconnected knowledge baseâ€”all while ensuring your data remains completely private on your local machine.

## Key Features

- **Node-Based Visual Interface:** Move beyond linear text logs. Every interaction is a movable, selectable node on an infinite canvas.
- **Non-Linear Conversation Flow:** Branch your conversation from any previous node to explore alternative ideas without losing context.
- **Local and Private LLM Integration:** Powered by **Ollama**, all AI processing happens locally. Your conversations are never sent to the cloud, ensuring 100% privacy.
- **Flexible Model Selection:** Choose from a list of popular preset models or specify any custom model compatible with Ollama. The application validates and ensures the model is available locally before use.
- **Rich Organizational Tools:**
    - **Frames:** Group related nodes into logical clusters with customizable titles and colors.
    - **Notes:** Add persistent, editable sticky notes to the canvas for annotations and reminders.
    - **Navigation Pins:** Drop pins on important nodes and access them instantly from a dedicated overlay, creating a table of contents for your canvas.
- **AI-Powered Content Generation:**
    - **Chart Generation:** Ask the AI to summarize data and generate `matplotlib` charts (Bar, Line, Pie, Histogram, and Sankey) directly on the canvas.
    - **Key Takeaways & Explainers:** Right-click any node to generate a concise summary or a simplified explanation, which appear as new, formatted notes.
- **Advanced View and Canvas Controls:**
    - **Infinite Canvas:** Pan and zoom freely across a vast workspace.
    - **Custom UI Controls:** Fine-tune grid snapping, panning speed, and zoom levels.
- **Comprehensive Session Management:**
    - **Chat Library:** Save, load, rename, and manage all your conversation canvases.
    - **Secure Local Database:** All sessions, including nodes, frames, notes, and pins, are stored securely in a local SQLite database.

## Technical Architecture

Graphite has recently undergone a major architectural refactor to improve modularity and maintainability. The codebase is now split into logical components with a clear separation of concerns.

-   **`graphite_app.py`**: The main application entry point. It contains the primary `ChatWindow` class and is responsible for initializing and launching the application.

-   **`graphite_ui.py`**: Consolidates all classes related to the User Interface layer. This includes all Qt widgets, dialogs, custom graphics items (`ChatNode`, `ConnectionItem`, `Frame`), and view components (`ChatView`, `ChatScene`).

-   **`graphite_core.py`**: Manages the application's core logic and data persistence. It contains the `ChatDatabase` class for all SQLite operations and the `ChatSessionManager` for handling the serialization/deserialization of chat sessions.

-   **`graphite_agents.py`**: Isolates all logic related to AI model interaction. This module contains the base `ChatAgent`, specialized tool agents (`KeyTakeawayAgent`, `ChartDataAgent`), and their corresponding `QThread` workers for asynchronous processing.

## Technology Stack

-   **Language:** Python 3.8+
-   **UI Framework:** PySide6
-   **Local LLM Interface:** Ollama
-   **Charting Library:** Matplotlib
-   **Database:** SQLite
-   **Icons:** QtAwesome (FontAwesome)

## Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to get Graphite running on your local machine.

### 1. Prerequisites

-   **Python:** Ensure you have Python 3.8 or newer installed.
-   **Ollama:** You must have **[Ollama](https://ollama.com/)** installed and running.

### 2. Install an LLM Model

Before running Graphite, you need to pull a model for Ollama to use. The default is `qwen2.5:7b-instruct`. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
ollama pull qwen2.5:7b-instruct
```

You can use the in-app Model Selection dialog to choose and validate other models. Ensure the Ollama application is running in the background.

### 3. Clone and Install Dependencies

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dovvnloading/Graphite.git
    cd Graphite
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate

    # For macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required Python packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(If a `requirements.txt` is not available, install manually: `pip install PySide6 ollama matplotlib qtawesome`)*

### 4. Run the Application

Once the setup is complete, launch the application by running:

```bash
python graphite_app.py
```

## Usage

-   **Sending Messages:** Type your message in the input box at the bottom and press Enter or click the send button. A new user node will appear, followed by a connected AI response node.
-   **Setting Context:** To branch the conversation, simply click on any previous node. The input box will indicate it's your new context. Your next message will create a new branch from that selected node.
-   **Interacting with Nodes:**
    -   **Move:** Click and drag any node to reposition it.
    -   **Select:** Click a node to select it, or drag a selection box to select multiple nodes.
    -   **Context Menu:** Right-click a node to access options like copying text, generating takeaways, creating charts, or deleting the node.
-   **Keyboard Shortcuts:**
    -   `Ctrl + F`: Create a Frame around selected nodes.
    -   `Ctrl + N`: Create a new Note at the cursor's position.
    -   `Delete`: Delete any selected item (node, frame, note, etc.).
    -   `Ctrl + S`: Save the current chat session.
    -   `Ctrl + L`: Open the Chat Library.

---
Known issues: The graph generation is very brittle and not very stable. Note: Larger models do handle chart data far better than smaller models, however the system requirements to use the larger models is significantly larger.
